    <td>The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe
     a document written in a markup language such as HTML. In addition to HTML and JavaScript. 
   CSS, CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web designed to enable the separation
    of presentation and content, including layout , colors and fonts. This separation can improve 
  accessibility of content, provide greater flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
 characteristics, allow multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying rel.</td>
  <td>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is classbased, object-oriented and
  built to have as few dependencies as possible on implementation. It is intended to let application
  developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all Java-supporting 
 platforms without recompiling. Java programs are generally compiled to bytecodes that can run on any Java 
 virtual machine ( JVM), regardless of the computer architecture underlying. Java's syntax is similar to C and
  C++, but it does have less low-level facilities than either.By 2019, with a reported 9 million developers, Java was one of
 the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, especially for client-server web applications.</td>
