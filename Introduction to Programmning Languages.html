    <p style="color:black"> Usually the description of a programming language is divided 
    into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (sign). Some languages are defined
     by a specification document (for example, an ISO Standard specifies the programming language
    for C) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as
    a reference. Some languages have both common, with a standard defined basic language, and extensions 
    taken from the dominant implementation."</p>
